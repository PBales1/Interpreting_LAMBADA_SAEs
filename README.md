# Interpreting_LAMBADA_SAEs
Extending the Linear Representation Hypothesis via Transcoder-Style SAEs and Feature Steering on Hallucinations on the LAMBADA Dataset

This Repository holds code for extracting the top features (via SAEs) corresponding to hallucinations on the LAMBADA dataset -- a dataset containing cloze-style/'fill-in-the-blank'-style questions. These features are then steered to increase the amount of hallucinations in generating responses to LAMBADA prompts.  See the included paper for an in-depth overview and discussion of this project and its results.
