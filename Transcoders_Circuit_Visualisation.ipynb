        "This notebook attempts to extract semantic 'meaning' from the top hallucination-causing features extracted from SAE_Hallucination_Interpretability.ipynb through the use of Transcoder Circuits.  It is recommended to run that notebook first to find the top features deemed to be causing hallucinations in long-context narrative cloze-style tasks (though also seemingly any cloze-style task, as demonstrated in the 'Continuity of Hallucination-Causing Features to Other Datasets' section). We theorise in that notebook that these top features capture the underlying structures rather than semantic relationships of the representation space, which we test in this notebook."
